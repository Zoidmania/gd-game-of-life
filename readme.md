# Conway's Game of Life

Trying to teach myself Godot. Conway's Game of Life is a simple enough program. There's a logic
loop with simple tilemap updates. Minimal input from the user, a simple UI, no collision logic.

Decisions I made, with simplicity in mind:

- The world isn't infinite. It's a small rectangular grid.
- There are only two speeds: "fast" and "slow".
- Not worrying about logic optimization, just correctness.
